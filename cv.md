## Summary 
I like doing design. Now I have several projects, [one of them is commercial](http://sharuk.tilda.ws) and I'm working hard on it now.

I want to be a highly skilled UX/UI designer or/and frontend developer because I also like coding. I spend all my free time designing and programming. I am doing my best to become an expert in these fields.

I like programming since my childhood, but 20 years ago this direction was not as developed as it is now. I really regret that I gave up making websites at the age of 15. I made three sites, but now they are no longer on the Internet.
